The project focuses on document similarity using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), a powerful technique in natural language processing and machine learning. Document similarity is crucial for various applications, including information retrieval, recommen- dation systems, and clustering of related documents. This project utilizes the 20 News- groups dataset, which contains approximately 20,000 newsgroup documents across 20 different categories. The goal is to analyze and measure the similarity between these documents based on their textual content.To achieve this, the project employs TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to convert the text data into a numeri- cal format suitable for analysis. Following this, SVD is applied to reduce the dimension- ality of the data, thereby facilitating more efficient computation of document similari- ties. The cosine similarity metric is then utilized to quantify how similar two documents are based on their vector representations.
